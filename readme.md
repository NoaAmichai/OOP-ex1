what are design patters?
In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

observer explanation:In software design and engineering, the observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject,
maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
